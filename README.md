# SimulationNoise
Fast Divergence-Free Noise with a Geometric Rationale

Simulation noise existed before curl noise, executes more quickly and has a geometric rationale for producing turbulence and eddies for artistic simulation.

This is a reference implementation in C++, but could easily be modified for use in C by removing things like inline and const keywords.
